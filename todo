things to train:


- Use Isomap to visalise Cifar10
- Use Isomap to visualise Cifar10 + Data-Augmented images
- define Resnet model, or get predefined model from either timm or huggingface
- write training and evaluation loops for cifar10 with arbitrary model, option for data-augment
- train resnet on cifar10
- train polynomial regressions (using Cross-Entropy Loss) on cifar10, with and without data-augment
- train polynomial regressions on subsampled cifar10 (to allow for larger poly order), with and without data-augment
- find top eigenvectors of the hessian for all trained models, to precondition HMC
- run nuts with found eigenvectors for all models and all possible permutations of settings

Figures:

- Isomap 2d Embedding Cifar10, classes highlighted
- Isomap 3d Embedding Cifar10, classes highlighted
- Isomap 2d Embedding Cifar10+augment, classes highlighted
- Isomap 3d Embedding Cifar10+augment, classes highlighted
- resnet model training loss & accuracy vs iteration number, no data-augment
- resnet model training loss & accuracy vs iteration number, yes data-augment
- Table with accuracies for polynomial models of all tested orders, with/without subsampling, with/without data-augment, with/without HMC

Paper:

- write explanation of resnets
- write explanation of HMC
- write explanation of data-augmenting procedure
- write analysis on the impact of HMC on accuracy
- conclude whether resnets alone beat the shitty polynomial regression + HMC + data-augment
